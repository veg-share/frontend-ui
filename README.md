# Garden Party Frontend UI

Garden Party is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that allows home gardeners to find and share surplus harvest with their community. A user can create a post with a title, description, and image, as well as search posts from all users.

This project was built by a team of five software engineers at the [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.edu/). It is composed of a frontend application built with React and a backend application built using Ruby on Rails and GraphQL.
